Or choose between safety and equal justice. \\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \\n\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \\n\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \\n\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \\n\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \\n\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \\n\\nWe cannot let this happen. \\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \\n\\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \\n\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.', metadata={}),\n",

       "     Document(page_content=\"Yes. I think we already see that a little bit. I already kind of think of neural nets as a kind of  program. I think of deep learning as basically learning programs that  have more than one step. So if you draw a flowchart, or if you draw a [TensorFlow graph](https://www.easy-tensorflow.com/tf-tutorials/basics/graph-and-session) describing your machine learning model, I think of the depth of that graph is describing the number of steps that run in sequence, and then the width of that graph is the number of steps that  run in parallel. Now it's been long enough that we've had deep learning working that it's a little bit silly to even discuss [shallow learning](http://www.princeton.edu/~aaa/Public/Teaching/ORF523/S17/ORF523_S17_Lec17_guest.pdf) anymore. But back when I first got involved in AI, when we used machine  learning, we were usually learning things like [Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine);  you could have a lot of input features to the model and you could multiply each feature by a different weight but all those multiplications were done in parallel to each other; there wasn't a lot  done in series. I think what we got with deep learning was really the ability to have steps of a program that run in sequence. And I think  that we've actually started to see that what's important with deep learning is more the fact that we have a multi-step program rather than the fact that we've learned a representation. If you look at things like [ResNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network), for example, they take one particular kind of representation and they update it several times. Back when deep learning first really took off in the academic world in 2006, when [Geoff Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) showed that you could train [deep belief networks](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_belief_networks). Everybody, who was interested in the idea, thought of it as each layer learns a different level of abstraction, but the first layer trained on images learns something like edges, and the second layer learns corners, and eventually you get these kind of grandmother's cell units that recognize specific objects. Today, I think, most people think of it more as a computer program where as you add more layers you can do more updates before you output your  final number. But I don't think anybody believes the layer 150 of the  ResNet it is a grand grandmother cell, and layer 100 is contours, or something like that.\", metadata={'speaker': 'Ian', 'statement_index': 4, 'time': 341.6}),\n",

Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \\n\\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \\n\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \\n\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \\n\\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \\n\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \\n\\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \\n\\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \\n\\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \\n\\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \\n\\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.  \\n\\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. \\n\\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \\n\\nAll of these will lower costs. \\n\\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.  \\n\\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.  \\n\\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \\n\\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \\n\\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. \\n\\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. \\n\\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.  \\n\\nSo that’s my plan.

I already kind of think of neural nets as a kind of  program. I think of deep learning as basically learning programs that  have more than one step. So if you draw a flowchart, or if you draw a [TensorFlow graph](https://www.easy-tensorflow.com/tf-tutorials/basics/graph-and-session) describing your machine learning model, I think of the depth of that graph is describing the number of steps that run in sequence, and then the width of that graph is the number of steps that  run in parallel. Now it's been long enough that we've had deep learning working that it's a little bit silly to even discuss [shallow learning](http://www.princeton.edu/~aaa/Public/Teaching/ORF523/S17/ORF523_S17_Lec17_guest.pdf) anymore. But back when I first got involved in AI, when we used machine  learning, we were usually learning things like [Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine);  you could have a lot of input features to the model and you could multiply each feature by a different weight but all those multiplications were done in parallel to each other; there wasn't a lot  done in series. I think what we got with deep learning was really the ability to have steps of a program that run in sequence. And I think  that we've actually started to see that what's important with deep learning is more the fact that we have a multi-step program rather than the fact that we've learned a representation. If you look at things like [ResNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network), for example, they take one particular kind of representation and they update it several times. Back when deep learning first really took off in the academic world in 2006, when [Geoff Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) showed that you could train [deep belief networks](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_belief_networks). Everybody, who was interested in the idea, thought of it as each layer learns a different level of abstraction, but the first layer trained on images learns something like edges, and the second layer learns corners, and eventually you get these kind of grandmother's cell units that recognize specific objects. Today, I think, most people think of it more as a computer program where as you add more layers you can do more updates before you output your  final number. But I don't think anybody believes the layer 150 of the  ResNet it is a grand grandmother cell, and layer 100 is contours, or something like that.\", metadata={'speaker': 'Ian', 'statement_index': 4, 'time': 341.6}),\n",

There's some unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms that can reduce the amount of labeled data you need, but they still require a lot of unlabeled data. Reinforcement Learning algorithms they don't need labels but they need really a lot of experiences. As human beings we don't  want to play [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) by failing at Pong two million times. So, just getting the generalization ability better is one of the most important  bottlenecks and the capability of the technology today. Then, I guess, I'd also say deep learning is like a component of a bigger system. So far, nobody is really proposing to have only what you'd call deep learning as the entire ingredient of intelligence. You use deep learning as sub-modules of other systems. Like [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) has a deep learning  model that estimates the value function, most reinforcement learning  algorithms have a deep learning module that estimates which action to  take next but you might have other components.\", metadata={'speaker': 'Ian', 'statement_index': 2, 'time': 164.8}),\n",

I do think that there are a lot of  ideas that can be developed really quickly. GANs were probably a little bit of an outlier on the whole like one-hour timescale [right] But just in terms of a like low resource ideas where you do something really different on the algorithm scale and get a big payback. I think it's not as likely that you'll see that in terms of things like core machine learning technologies like a better classifier, or a better reinforcement learning algorithm, or a better generative model. If I had the GAN idea today it would be a lot harder to prove that it was useful than it was back in 2014 because I would need to get it running on  something like ImageNet or [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) at high-resolution.

Now it's been long enough that we've had deep learning working that it's a little bit silly to even discuss [shallow learning](http://www.princeton.edu/~aaa/Public/Teaching/ORF523/S17/ORF523_S17_Lec17_guest.pdf) anymore. But back when I first got involved in AI, when we used machine  learning, we were usually learning things like [Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine);  you could have a lot of input features to the model and you could multiply each feature by a different weight but all those multiplications were done in parallel to each other; there wasn't a lot  done in series. I think what we got with deep learning was really the ability to have steps of a program that run in sequence. And I think  that we've actually started to see that what's important with deep learning is more the fact that we have a multi-step program rather than the fact that we've learned a representation. If you look at things like [ResNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network), for example, they take one particular kind of representation and they update it several times. Back when deep learning first really took off in the academic world in 2006, when [Geoff Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) showed that you could train [deep belief networks](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_belief_networks). Everybody, who was interested in the idea, thought of it as each layer learns a different level of abstraction, but the first layer trained on images learns something like edges, and the second layer learns corners, and eventually you get these kind of grandmother's cell units that recognize specific objects. Today, I think, most people think of it more as a computer program where as you add more layers you can do more updates before you output your  final number. But I don't think anybody believes the layer 150 of the  ResNet it is a grand grandmother cell, and layer 100 is contours, or something like that.\", metadata={'speaker': 'Ian', 'statement_index': 4, 'time': 341.6}),\n",

GANs were probably a little bit of an outlier on the whole like one-hour timescale [right] But just in terms of a like low resource ideas where you do something really different on the algorithm scale and get a big payback. I think it's not as likely that you'll see that in terms of things like core machine learning technologies like a better classifier, or a better reinforcement learning algorithm, or a better generative model. If I had the GAN idea today it would be a lot harder to prove that it was useful than it was back in 2014 because I would need to get it running on  something like ImageNet or [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) at high-resolution. You know, those take a while to train you couldn't you couldn't train it in an hour and know that it was something really new and exciting.
