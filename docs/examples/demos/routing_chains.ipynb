    "# Routing Chains\n",
    "Some applications will require not just a predetermined chain of calls to LLMs/other tools, but potentially an unknown chain that depends on the user input. In these types of chains, there is a \"router\" LLM chain which has access to a suite of tools. Depending on the user input, the router can then decide which, if any, of these tools to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of chains are called Routing Chains. When used correctly these can be extremely powerful. The purpose of this notebook is to go through the core abstractions at the heart of Routing Chains and enable you to build applications with them."

    "- Tool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.\n",
    "- Tool Input: The input string to a tool.\n",
    "- Observation: The output from calling a tool on a particular input.\n",
    "- Router: The object responsible for deciding which tools to call and when. Exposes a `route` method, which takes in a string and returns a Router Output.\n",
    "- Router Output: The object returned from calling `Router.route` on a string. Consists of:\n",
    "    - The tool to use\n",
    "    - The input to that tool\n",
    "    - A log of the router's thinking. This is not required, as it's only used for logging purposes, but it can be helpful for understanding why the router is acting why it is\n",
    "- Routing Chain: A chain which is made up of a router and suite of tools. When passed a string, the Routing Chain will iterative call tools as needed until it arrives at a Final Answer.\n",
    "- Final Answer: The final output of a Routing Chain."

Although it doesn't necessarily have to be backed by a language model (LLM), for pretty much all current use cases it is.
