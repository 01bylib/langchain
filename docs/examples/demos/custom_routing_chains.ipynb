    "- Tool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output.\n",
    "- Tool Input: The input string to a tool.\n",
    "- Observation: The output from calling a tool on a particular input.\n",
    "- Router: The object responsible for deciding which tools to call and when. Exposes a `route` method, which takes in a string and returns a Router Output.\n",
    "- Router Output: The object returned from calling `Router.route` on a string. Consists of:\n",
    "    - The tool to use\n",
    "    - The input to that tool\n",
    "    - A log of the router's thinking.\n",
    "- Routing Chain: A chain which is made up of a router and suite of tools. When passed a string, the Routing Chain will iterative call tools as needed until it arrives at a Final Answer.\n",
    "- Final Answer: The final output of a Routing Chain."

Although it doesn't necessarily have to be backed by a language model (LLM), for pretty much all current use cases it is.
