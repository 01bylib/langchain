Chat Models
=============

WARNING: extreme WIP

Chat models are new models that rather than being text-in and text-out send a list of dicitionaries, each dictionary representing a chat utterance including the text of the chat and the "speaker" of the chat.

The examples here all highlight how to work with Chat Models.
